            ACKNOWLEGMENT
            I want to thank GOD for being my major source of strength and zeal throughout my SIWES period, for HIS guidance, provision and protection throughput the three months of my SIWES program.
            I would like to acknowledge the Director, Information Technology Services (I.T.S), FUTMINNA for allowing me do my SIWES training under him and his staff. I would also like to thank all the staff of ITS for their leadership and words of encouragement at every step of the training.
            I also wish to express my gratitude to the heads under Networking unit; Hajiya Khadijat, Engr. Ndagi, Engr. Yinusa, Mr. Shehu and Mallam Jimoh for their support, always teaching new things, correcting and exposing me to new challenges and showing me the appropriate means of solving them. 
            I appreciate u all.
